Q. What is Java?
A. Java is a high-level, object oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems now owned by Oracle Corporation.

High-level language:
1. Abstraction: It takes away the details of hardware which makes it easy to write and understand code.
2. Ease of use: It has human-readable syntax, strong error-checking and powerful development tools which simplifies complex tasks.
3. Platform Independence: The programs written in Java are compiled into byte code which can be run on any device having a
                          Java Virtual Machine(JVM) which follows WORA property - Write Once, Run Anywhere.
4.  Advanced Features: It provides extensive libraries, supports object-oriented programming and handles memory management automatically.


Object-Oriented Language:
1. Classes and objects : Java uses classes as blueprints to create objects which are instances of data and methods.
2. Abstraction: It hides complex details which makes it easier to read and write code.
3. Inheritence: New classes can access previous classes' data and methods supporting code reuseability.
4. Encapsulation: Data and methods are grouped together in a single unit.
5. Polymorphism: Methods can perform different tasks. One interface can handle multiple tasks.

History and evolution of Java:
- Java was created by Sun Microsystems in mid-1990s.
- Created by a development team led by James Gosling.
- Was Initially called "Oak" inspired by an oak try outside Gosling's office.
- Later name was changed to Java inspired by Java Coffee to avoid trademark issues with Oak Technologies.


- 1991 - The Green Project: Java was started as a part of Green Project, an initiative whic aimed to develop intelligent consumer electronic devices.
- 1995 - Public Introduction : It was officially released in 1995 as Java 1.0 by Sun MicroSystems as WORA language emphasizing its cross platform capablities.
- 1996  - JDK 1.0 : The first official release og JDK 1.0 made Java accesible as it provided the tools needed by developers to write Java Programs.

Evolution over the years:

- 1997 : Java 1.1 - Contaied features 1. inner classes 2. JavaBeans 3. JDBC(Java Database Connectivity)
- 1998 : Java 2 - Java 2 introduced the Swing graphical API, Collections Framework, and performance improvements.
- 2011 - Java 7: Introduced the try-with-resources statement, the diamond operator, and improved support for dynamic languages.

Key Features of Java:

1. Simple:
2. Object-oriented:
3. Platform-Indepedent:
4. Secure:
5. Robust:
6. Supports Multithreading:
7. Architecture-neutral:
8. Compiled and Interpreted:
